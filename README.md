# Converter
Write a Python script that takes a PDF file and converts it into speech.
To convert a PDF file into speech using Python, you can use the `PyPDF2` library to extract the text from the PDF file, and then use the `pyttsx3` library to convert the text into speech. Here's an example script:

```python
import pyttsx3
import PyPDF2

# Function to convert PDF to text
def pdf_to_text(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(file)
        text = ""
        for page in range(pdf_reader.numPages):
            page_obj = pdf_reader.getPage(page)
            text += page_obj.extractText()
    return text

# Function to convert text to speech
def text_to_speech(text):
    engine = pyttsx3.init()
    engine.setProperty('rate', 150)  # Adjust the speech rate (default is 200)
    engine.setProperty('volume', 1)  # Adjust the speech volume (default is 1)
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()

# Main script
if __name__ == '__main__':
    pdf_file = 'path/to/your/pdf_file.pdf'
    extracted_text = pdf_to_text(pdf_file)
    text_to_speech(extracted_text)
```

Make sure to install the required libraries `pyttsx3` and `PyPDF2` before running the script. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install pyttsx3 PyPDF2
```

Replace `'path/to/your/pdf_file.pdf'` with the actual path to your PDF file. The script will extract the text from the PDF file and then convert it into speech using the default system text-to-speech engine.

Feel free to adjust the speech rate and volume by modifying the `rate` and `volume` properties of the `pyttsx3` engine object.

Note that the accuracy of text extraction from the PDF depends on the structure and formatting of the PDF file. In some cases, the extracted text may not be perfect due to complex layouts or scanned images within the PDF.
